    "# Background \n",
    "This code implements a spiking neural net with conductance in input. the following equations govern the dynamic of the network. \n",
    "### Trans-membrane voltage dynamics\n",
    "first we model the transmembrane voltage as \n",
    "$$\\tau_m \\frac{dV_i}{dt}= - V_i(t)+ R_m \\times I^{syn}_i(t) $$ \n",
    "$$ {\\tau_a}_i \\frac{dB_i(t)}{dt} = b_i^0 -B_i(t)$$ \n",
    "where, $R_m$ is membrane resistance, $\\tau_m$ is membrane time constant, and ${\\tau_a}_i$ is adaptation time constant  .\n",
    "the synaptic current relates to synaptic activations in the following way\n",
    "$$I^{syn}_i(t)= \\sum_j W^{in}_{ij} \\times X(t) + \\sum_j W^{rec}_{ij} \\times S_j(t) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "### Neuron firing dynamics \n",
    "The firing dynamics of the neuron is model as a simple reseting. More specifically, \n",
    "$$V_i \\rightarrow V_{reset} \\ \\ \\  if \\ \\ \\ V_i>=V_{\\Theta} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ V_{\\Theta}$ represent the threshold voltage and $V_{reset}$ is the reset voltage of the neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input dynamics \n",
    "Input synapes are the the site of learning in the spiking network. Below a conductance based formulation is presented. \n",
    "First, the time-dependent input conductance to membrane is calculated as follows \n",
    "$$ g_i(t) = \\sum_j W_{ij} S_{j}(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "the term $j$ reperesent all the neurons that have a synapse onto the neuron $i$. the time dependence of conductance is due to $S(t)$ which represent the spiking activity for neurons connected to neuron $i$ . The spiking activity has the following governing equations \n",
    "$$ S_{j} \\rightarrow 1 \\quad if \\ neuron\\ j\\ fires$$\n",
    "$$ o.w. S_j = 0$$\n",
